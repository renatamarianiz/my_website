Our aim is to calculate the expected number of rentals per month between 2015-2019. Afterwards, we will see how each month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals.

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
```

First we will upload the TfL data of daily-bike rentals with the following code.

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


Our aim is to calculate the expected number of rentals per month between 2015-2019. Afterwards, we will see how each month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. For that, we will first calculate the average bike rentals for each month (considering all years). Later we will plot the monthly weekly rental average per year and fill the difference between this and the expected average. When the monthly average per year is lower than the total average, the fill should be red, otherwise green.


```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change_code}

#first we need to filter our database to have only years >= 2015
bike_filtered <- 
  bike %>% filter(year >= 2015)

#summarizing per month - we don't need the week value, only monthly
bike_filtered <- 
  bike_filtered %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarize(bikes_hired = mean(bikes_hired))

#now we will calculate the monthly average throughout the years and save it in a new column
bike_filtered <- 
  bike_filtered %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(average_hire = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup()

#calculate the change from monthly average
bike_filtered <-
  bike_filtered  %>% 
  mutate(change_monthlyavg = bikes_hired - average_hire)

#we will first need to interpolate the dataframe to fix graph intersections while making the ribbon
bike_interp <- bike_filtered  %>% 
  #splitting the dataframe - one for each year
  split(.$year) %>% 
  #now we will create a df of interpolated values using map
                      #interpolated months and bikes hired
  map_df(~data.frame(year = approx(.x$month, .x$bikes_hired, n = 80), 
                     #interpolated months and avg hire
                     nat = approx(.x$month, .x$average_hire, n = 80), 
                     #label for each year
                     year = .x$year[1],
                     #label for each month
                     month = .x$month[1]))

#creating a vector with month names
month_label <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar",
           "Apr", "May", "Jun",
           "Jul", "Aug","Sep", 
           "Oce", "Nov", "Dec")

#now we will plot our graph with these interpolated values
challenge2.1 <- ggplot(bike_interp, aes(x = nat.x,y= nat.y)) +  facet_wrap(~year) +
  geom_line(color = "#1d00f6", size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(nat.x, year.y), color = "black") +
  #adding ribbons - fills area between plots
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = nat.y, ymax = pmin(year.y, nat.y)), fill = "#EAB5B7" , alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = year.y, ymax = pmin(year.y, nat.y)), fill = "#CBECCE", alpha = 0.8) +
  #change theme
  theme_minimal() +
  #change our x-axis, currently it has the interpolated values
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12),
        labels=month_label) +
  #adding titles
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store",
       y = "Bike rentals",
       x = "") +
  #making titles bold
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(face = "bold")) #+

Due to the lockdown restrictions imposed by the government as a measurement to fight the current pandemic, 2020 has had the lowest rental values for March and April. In these months it would be normally expected an increase in rentals due to the end of winter and beginning of spring. On the other hand, values rocketed in just one month (from April to May). This is probably because restrictions still applied and people wanted to do some physical exercise, and at the same time not spend so much money on purchasing a new bike. Values for July are under the expected when considering the normal bike rental average. Notwithstanding, even though the sudden increase in usage, 2018 shows the highest amount of bike rentals, specifically during the summer.

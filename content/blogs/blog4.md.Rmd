```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)

Firstly, we will take a quicky look at the results of the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK.

```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("Data","brexit_results.csv"))

glimpse(brexit_results)

```

To get a sense of the spread of the data, let's plot a histogram and a density plot of the leave share in all constituencies.

```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)  +
  labs(title = "2016 Brexit leave share in all constituencies",
       subtitle = "Histogram",
       x = "Leave share (%)",
       y = "Quantity of constituencies")

ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density() +  
  labs(title = "2016 Brexit leave share in all constituencies",
       subtitle = "Density Function",
       x = "Leave share (%)",
       y = "Density of votes")

```

A common explanation for this outcome is the fear of immigation and the opposition to the EU's more open border policy. 

## Correlation between native born residents and the leave share

To check this hyphothesis we will calculate the correlation between the proportion of native born residents (`born_in_uk`) in a constituency and its `leave_share`.

```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```

Since the correlation value is almost 0.5, we can see that both variables are positively correlated.

Now let's create a scatterplot to graphically show the relationship between both variables

```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() +  
  labs(title = "Correlation of the Leave Shares and Native Born Residents per constituency",
       x = "Native born residents (%)",
       y = "Leave share (%)") +
  NULL
```


The graph above depics our hiphothesis formulated before. It is clear that the more native born residents in a constituency, the grater the leave share. This is probably because UK residents are more conservative and thus want to mitigate the risk of being kept in the EU specially due to the immigration policies adopted. Additionally, people tend to want to protect their own culture and believes. Hence, it is believed that high immigration rates decrease cultural characteristics of a country. 

Robert Hutton confirms in his article for Bloomberg that the main argument used by Brexit campaigners was worries about immigration. In addition, it is also said that younger people tend to be less conservative, and thus, tended to vote against Brexit.

## Calculating the correlation between the proportion of young voters and the leave share

```{r brexit_age_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, age_18to24) %>% 
  cor()
```
The correlation indicates a moderate/low negative correlation between the data. Now, we should plot this result in a graph.

```{r brexit_age_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = age_18to24, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() +  
  labs(title = "Correlation of the Leave Shares and the % of young voters per constituency",
       x = "age 18 to 24 (%)",
       y = "Leave share (%)") +
  NULL
```

Although the level correlation wasn't very high, through the graph we can see a slight relaton between the amount of young voters and the leave share. The less young people, the higher the leave share. Notwitstanding, this low correlation can be due to two factors: not many young people have voted or/and the population of people in this age range is considerably low when compared to other age groups.Therefore, their vote did not influence much. To get better results, a greater age range (with more voters) should have been analyzed.

## Comparison of the four major UK Parties

Here we will compare the four major UK parties Conservative, Labour, UKIP and Liberal Democrats accorind to the percetage that voted for leaving the EU. To visualise the results, I decided to use a scatterplot.

First I wanted to have a look at the dataset provided and therefore used the skim and summary function of R.

```{r}

skim(brexit_results)
summary(brexit_results)

```

As the dataframe had four different columns for each party, I decided to create a new dataframe that has a column called party and includes all four parties.

```{r}
#adding column called party to link all parties 
brexit_long <- gather(brexit_results, party, percentage, con_2015:ukip_2015, factor_key=TRUE)
```


In this part I plotted the actual graph using the ggplot2 package of R. I used the official color of the parties and customized the graph.

```{r}
ggplot(brexit_long, aes(x = percentage ,y=leave_share, color = party))+
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(title = "How political affiliation translated to Brexit Voting", 
       x = "Party % in the UK 2015 general election", 
       y = "Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referendum") +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0.05,0.05),limits=c(0 ,20, 40, 60, 80))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#0087DC","#DC241f","#FDBB30","#EFE600"), name = "", labels = c("Conservative", "Labour", "Lib Dems", "UKIP") ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal", plot.title =element_text(face="bold")) 
  
```


The graph finally illustrates a scatterplot. Each datapoint presents one eligible voting district. Fo the Conservative and Labour party, the graph shows no matter how high ther percentage in the 2015 general election was, the percentage of people voting to leave the EU was about 50%. This indicates that there is no strong correlatio between these two variables. At the same time the percentage in the 2015 general election and the percentage voting to leave the EU are highly correlated for the UKIP party, meaning the higher the percentage in the 2015 general election in a district, the more voted pro Brexit. Lastly, the Lib Dems line is a decreasing slope, which indicates a slight negative correlation between the percentage in the 2015 general election and the percentage voting to leave the EU.
